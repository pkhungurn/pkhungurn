I'm a software engineer and researcher from Thailand. I'm interested in computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, algorithms, and mathematics in general. 

Nowadays, I mainly work on the application of machine learning to character animation. I have created several models that can create simple animations of an anime character given as a single image.
